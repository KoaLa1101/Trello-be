          Failed to implement Card.todos, tried:

          - `Types::CardType#todos`, which did not exist
          - `Card#todos`, which did not exist
          - Looking up hash key `:todos` or `"todos"` on `#<Card:0x00007ffb4c434938>`, but it wasn't a Hash

          To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos)

          - `Types::CardType#todos`, which did not exist
          - `Card#todos`, which did not exist
          - Looking up hash key `:todos` or `"todos"` on `#<Card:0x0000562facf12bb0>`, but it wasn't a Hash

          To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos)

          Failed to implement Card.todos, tried:

          - `Types::CardType#todos`, which did not exist
          - `Card#todos`, which did not exist
          - Looking up hash key `:todos` or `"todos"` on `#<Card:0x0000562dfb275158>`, but it wasn't a Hash

          To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos)

          Failed to implement Card.todos, tried:

          - `Types::CardType#todos`, which did not exist
          - `Card#todos`, which did not exist
          - Looking up hash key `:todos` or `"todos"` on `#<Card:0x0000561930b60680>`, but it wasn't a Hash

          To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos)
